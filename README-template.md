## My process

The HTML was built in the most semantic way I could, the page components were organized with flex display, both the desktop and mobile versions. The CSS was written in a linear way with the page to make it easier to understand, the main properties used were padding and margin to adapt the texts in their blocks, transform translate was used to create the share box. The icons were taken from Font Awesome and the font from the Google Fonts website. In the JavaScript code, the toogle declaration was used, and through onClick events, to make it possible to open and close the pop-up when the selected button is clicked. The media queries were made only by changing the flex-direction of the main and increasing its size, adapting the font sizes and their spacing to their specific versions.
